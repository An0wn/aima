  The Mathematical Objection (3) still holds up: the halting problem;
  on the other hands, humans are also susceptible to the halting
  problem, aren't they? If one falls towards the humanity side of the
  humanity-rationality AI-axis, this deficit is reducible.
</p>
<p>
  Lady Lovelace's Objection (6) is interesting: it denies <i>ex nihilo</i>;
  are genetic algorithms a counter-example?
</p>
<p>
  The Argument from Informality of Behaviour (8) could be solved by
  fuzzy dispatch.
</p>
<p>
  A modern refutation might be that there are not enough graduate
  students to make a satisfactory ontology of world-knowledge; thank
  the gods, then, for mechanical turks and unsupervised learning!
</p>
<p>
  We came pretty damn close to \(30\%\) in the 2008 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loebner_Prize#2008">Loebner prize</a>; why not
  double it to \(60\%\) in 2058? Despite Moore's law, let's say that AI
  proceeds linearly.

  Reflex actions are rational in the sense that they are the result of
  induction on e.g. hot objects and the scientific method (see
  Turing); though the acquisition may require intelligence (induction,
  storage), the reflex itself is not intelligent in the sense that it
  requires no induction: it is immediate.
</p>
<p>
  Reflex actions are not irrational, either, in the sense that someone
  does a cost-benefit analysis and decides to contravene it; let's
  call reflex actions <i>pararational</i>, therefore: neither rational nor
  irrational. There's no time to apply a utility function and behave
  accordingly (or discordingly (sic)).

  Aplysia, Eric Kandel
</p>
<p>
  20,000 neurons; memory-updates/second: \(10^{-9}\); cycle time:
  \(10^15\), high end;
</p>
<p>
  Is memory-updates/second merely memory / cycle time? In which case:
  \(20000 / 10^-9 = 10^5 (20000)\) neurons, cycle time: \(10^{-3}\);
  memory updates per second? Not sure what the relationship between
  operations/sec and memory updates/sec; the former is an upper bound,
  though. Could it be that memory updates/sec is also bounded,
  somehow, by storage units? There is also the relationship between
  neuros and synapses.
</p>
<p>
  In humans, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurons#Connectivity">7,000 synapses per neuron</a>; hence 10<sup>14</sup> from 10<sup>11</sup>. How
  many synapses per aplysia-neuron?
</p>
<p>
  From <a href="http://learnmem.cshlp.org/content/10/5/387.full">this paper</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>On average, we found 24 contacts per pair of neurons.
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
  Let's say, then, that sea slugs have 10<sup>6</sup> synapses; let's also say
  that, like humans, this is an upper bound on memory updates per
  second due to the e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential#Refractory_period">refractory period</a>.
</p>
<p>
  That gives 10<sup>6</sup> memory updates per second; which means that a
  supercomputer houses the potential of 10<sup>8</sup> sea slugs.

  This post on the <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/6p6/the_limits_of_introspection/">limits of introspection</a> posits that:
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Mental processes are the results of opaque preferences, and . . .
our own "introspected" goals and preferences are a product of the
same machinery that infers goals and preferences in others in order
to predict their behavior.
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
  Accordingly, introspection is accurate to the extent that we can
  infer our own thoughts from the mental model we've extrapolated from
  watching others.
</p>
<p>
  In other words, the processes which lead to thought are to thought
  opaque.

  Bar code scanners should hopefully be a trivial mapping from codes
  to products; if, on the other hand, you could scan and select
  similar products someone might be interested in: well, then.

<p>
  The search engine problem is probably AI-complete; current solutions
  are some AI-complete-like heuristics.

  Voice-activated telephone menus might be artificially intelligent in
  the sense that they have to recover signal from noise and make sense
  of it.

<p>
  Internet routing algorithms are classic agents in the sense that
  they have environments (connection data), sensors (the ability to
  peer into network devices) and actuators (the ability to re-route
  traffic).

  Isn't it the case that humans do do some kind of implicit

  are complex physics at play, and yet the human has evolutionarily
  honed and ad-hoc facilities to perform the same.

  Something like Gaussian blur, in other words, is hard-coded into our

  Evolution might tend to result in systems that maximize certain
  utility functions (e.g. propagate genes, to that end: stay alive for
  a while; &amp;c.); this process is pseudo-rational. Pseudo-rational in
  the sense that it is not rational for rationality's sake; but
  accidentally rational as it strives to maximize utility.

  The relationship between nature and nurture is probably complex;

  It follows directly from the definition of a rational agent, which
  "maximizes its performance measure, given the evidence provided by
  the percept sequence" (p. 37), that its action "depends . . . on the
  time step it has reached."
</p>
<p>
  This is because the lifetime of an agent is measured by the total
  number of percepts it receives <sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> <sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.3" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>.
</p>
<p>
  Let \(t\) be the time step the agent has reached; if \(t \leq T\), the
  agent's performence measure depends upon the time step it has
  reached. If \(t &gt; T\), on the other hand, the rationality of the agent
  is undefined; since its performance measure is undefined.
</p>
<p>
  At \(t &gt; T\), the agent has become pararational (neither rational nor
  irrational).
</p>
<p>
  A rational agent's action, therefore, depends upon \(t\) only insofar
  as its performance measure depends upon \(t\).
</p>
<p>
  Take <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_rover">Opportunity</a>, for instance, which had a performance measure of
  \(T = 90\ \text{sol}\); as of 2012, it's overstepped \(T\) by eight
  years. If it fails after \(T\) to e.g. characterize soil, could you
  say that it acts rationally? In other words, is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_rover">Spirit</a> irrational;
  now that it has failed to meet its original performance measure?
</p>
<p>
  No: by their original performance measure, Opportunity and Spirit
  are pararational; which is not to say that you couldn't define
  another performance measure \(u^\prime\) depending upon another time
  \(T^\prime\).
</p>
<p>
  See page 38, by the way, where the authors talk about rationality in
  terms of expected performance; could it be that an agent transcends
  \(T\) with respect to expected performance?
</p>
<p>
  Example: given a penalty for each move, a reflex agent's expected
  performance would be just as good as any other's given T = 2; but
  not when T = 1000 (it would require a state-based agent to realize
  that the world is clean and stop moving).

<dt>c</dt><dd>True. It's possible to imagine a task environment in which

<p>
  I want environmental combinators, incidentally; such that I can
  compose an e.g. step-limited environment with an agent with a vacuum
  one.
</p>
<p>
  We can compose steps; but how do you compose score: do you have to
  specify a reducer of some kind; e.g. addition? Is it really
  environment reduction we're talking about here?
</p>
<p>
  I'm beginning to suspect that the performance score is a property of
  the agent, not the environment; this is consistent with the book's
  use of "reward" and "penalty." It also makes sense in a multi-agent
  environment.
</p>
<p>
  On page 37, however, the authors state that:
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>This notion of desirability [for a sequence of actions leading to a
sequence of states] is captured by a <b>performance measure</b> that
evaluates any given sequence of environment states.
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
  I suspect that, whereas the environment is an arbiter of the
  performance score (i.e. applies the performance measure), the score
  inheres in the agents.
</p>
<p>
  This is corroborated by the following:
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Notice that we said <i>environment</i> states, not <i>agent</i> states. If we
define success in terms of agent's opinion of its own performance,
an agent could achieve perfect rationality simply by deluding itself
that its performance was perfect.
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
  Since only the environment has access to its true states, it alone
  can measure performance. Is this problematic in cases where we don't
  have an omniscient environment that directly communicates
  performance scores? In such cases, we'd have to rely on the
  imperfect self-judgement of the agent; and attempt to converge on
  rationality by internal coherence.
</p>
<p>
  What I'm calling environments, incidentally, are now just functions:
  step-functions, at that; and can be reduced by <code>every</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Agent combinators are a little tough, though; the performance
  measure has to be aware of the combined features. Can we use some
  kind of message-passing mechanism?
</p>
<p>
  What stops us, for instance, as modelling the agents as lambdas;
  too? Part of the problem is the inversion of control: we'd have to
  pass a message to the agent to store its score, as opposed to
  manipulating the score directly.
</p>
<p>
  Every agent would be a dispatch-mechanism that would manage its own
  meta-variables (including score and e.g. location) on the basis of
  messages. Is it problematic, however, to have agents managing their
  own score? Could we have an agent &rarr; score mapping in the environment
  itself? That way, agents only maintain state according to its
  percepts.
</p>
<p>
  Score, for instance, is not a percept in the vacuum world; location,
  however, is. Agents, then, are functions with closures; functions
  which take as many parameters as their percepts have components. The
  performance-measuring-environment, therefore, maintains an
  <code>agent-&gt;score</code> table. Yes!
</p>
<p>
  Problem is, though, that we'd have to break the nice contract we
  have: environments are niladic lambdas. To maintain the performance
  measure table, we'd have to receive the agent and the new score.
</p>
<p>
  How to make the performance measure part of the environment, so that
  we can relieve the agent from metadata?
</p>
<p>
  By taking the metadata out of the agent, we have to maintain agent
  &rarr; metadata mappings in the environment; this is kind of a pain in
  the ass.
</p>
<p>
  By maintaining agents-as-lambda, we get a certain flexibility; on
  the other hand, we shunt some complexity onto the environment: as it
  has to maintain agent-metadata: score, location, &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
  Is this an acceptable tradeoff? The alternative, where I need to
  guess what agents need (program, score, location) seems onerous; for
  some reason. In practice, however, it may be simpler. We haven't
  even solved the agent-hashing-problem, for instance (wherein hashing
  fails if we mutate a field).
</p>
<p>
  Can we hash closures?
</p>
<p>
  I want to follow this environment-maintains-agent-&gt;metadata-mapping
  thing and see how far it goes. (I see now why objects are
  interesting; closures, of course, do the same thing.)
</p>
<p>
  If <code>make-*-environment</code> returned multiple values: the thunk followed
  by e.g. <code>agent-&gt;score</code>, <code>agent-&gt;location</code>; you can ignore the latter
  values, if you want to.
</p>
<p>
  Or, we can demand that the user furnish them; better yet, we can
  give the user the option of furnishing and ignoring them.
</p>
<p>
  Also, shouldn't we be able to name agents at some point? This would
  also have to fall within an external data structure. Maybe the
  record solution isn't problematic if we create ad-hoc agents for
  each problem.
</p>
<p>
  If we really need to decouple the program from the agent metadata
  (do we?), one solution is to have an agent-&gt;metadata table in the
  environment; the metadata would be a record containing location,
  score, name, &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
  This metadata table, on the other hand, would have to be passed to
  each subenvironment for composition. Seems like a pain.
</p>
<p>
  We found that, since environments consist of a step function, we
  could reduce them to a lambda; let's see if this continues to be the
  case. For the time being, however, I think using agent-records is
  simplifying.
</p>
<p>
  I wouldn't mind agents being lambdas with closures; problem is:
  can't access the closure without some kind of message passing.
  (Message passing simulates records.) We could possibly do it with
  some kind of multiple-return-values hack, in which the subsequent
  values are ignored (the agent effectively does a state dump every
  time its program is invoked). The problem with that is that I have
  to pass a percept in to access its state, or store its state some
  other way.
</p>
<p>
  To avoid namespacing everything (like e.g. <code>vacuum-agent</code>, &amp;c.), I'd
  like to have separate modules; that way, if we need to, we can
  import with a prefix.
</p>
<p>
  For learning purposes, we should allow the student to specify no
  more than the agent program; worry about all the bootstrapping on
  the back end.
</p>
<p>
  We may have to copy worlds, incidentally, to compare how e.g.
  reflex- vs. state-agents behave; thank goodness for <code>vector-copy</code>.
  (Copy by default?)
</p>
<p>
  To give feedback to students, should have an e.g.
  <code>environment-print</code> that we can pass around (this sort of
  function-passing, incidentally, is what Norvig sought to avoid);
  <code>environment-print</code> might happen at every step in e.g. <code>simulate</code>.
  Oh, <code>make-debugging-environment</code>.

    A simple reflex agent wouldn't be able to explore an environment of
    unknown extent without exhausting all possible paths of the
    corresponding \(n \times n\) space; given sufficient time, such an
    exhaustive agent would asymptotically approach rationality toward \(t
    = \infty\).
</p>
<p>
    Given reasonable time constraints, however, or e.g. penalties for
    moving, such an agent would not be rational; if it maintained all
    possible paths in a table, it would also contravene the directive on
    p. 47:
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The key challenge for AI is to find out how to write programs that,
to the extent possible, produce rational behavior from a smallish
program rather than from a vast table.
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
    More fundamentally, an agent wouldn't be able to exhaust the space
    without maintaining some sort of state (e.g. paths traversed).
</p>
<p>
    Even more fundamentally, however, the agent can't discern whether
    it's hit a wall; this changes in <a href="#sec-27">2.12</a>, however, when the agent
    gets a bump sensor.

  A simple reflex agent with a bump sensor will perform just as well
  as a random agent since, upon detecting a bump, it can randomly
  change directions. The same constraints on random agent apply: e.g.
  poor performance in linear spaces.
</p>
<p>
  The state agent is fundamentally unchanged: instead of deducing
  implicit bumps, however, due to non-movement (requiring e.g. a
  bump-sentinel in the movement stack); it can incorporate the
  bump-data directly into its state.
</p>
<p>
  If the bump sensor stops working, unfortunately, the agent would
  have to fall back on random behavior (see <a href="#sec-26-2">2.11b</a>).

   The state space is infinite: you can reach any square, for

</p>
<p>
   Let's say that redundant no√∂ps have been pruned, however; and that
   the graph, furthermore, doesn't have any cycles: the state space is
   at least \(n\), corresponding to the number of nodes in the graph. It
   is at least \(4n\), though, since the robot can be in any of the four
   orientations in each square. Let's say, furthermore, for every node
   \(n_i\) there are \(m_i\) unique paths (i.e. sequences \(n_{0, 1, \dots,
   i}\)) from the initial node \(n_0\) to \(n_i\): the state space for
   \(n_i\) alone becomes all the ways to fulfill each path in \(m_i\)
   including unnecessary turns and false-forwards into walls. Let the
   set of all fulfillments for a given \(m_i\) be \(M_i\).
</p>
<p>
   The state space is the sum of \(M_i\) over the number of nodes in the
   graph; plus the robots current position; plus the robot's
   orientation.

<li>David has the international version, which would have you write
     an essay on evolution and autonomy; see e.g. Turing on child AI:

<blockquote>

<p>     We have thus divided our problem into two parts. The and
     child-programme the education process. These two remain very
     closely connected. We cannot expect to find a good child-machine
     at the first attempt. One must experiment with teaching one such
     machine and see how well it learns. One can then try another and
     see if it is better or worse. There is an obvious connection
     between this process and evolution, by the identifications

<dt>Structure of the child machine</dt><dd>Hereditary material
</dd>
<dt>Changes</dt><dd>Mutations
</dd>
<dt>Natural selection</dt><dd>Judgment of the experimenter
</dd>
</dl>


<p>
     One may hope, however, that this process will be more expeditious
     than evolution. The survival of the fittest is a slow method for
     measuring advantages. The experimenter, by the exercise of
     intelligence, should be able to speed it up. Equally important is
     the fact that he is not restricted to random mutations. If he can
     trace a cause for some weakness he can probably think of the kind
     of mutation which will improve it.

<li>Real cognitive science, however, is necessarily based on

<li>For any logical expression satisfying certain conditions, one

</li>
<li>For every net behaving under one assumption, there exists
       another net which behaves under the other and gives the same
       results.
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Perhaps "computational rationality" would have been more precise
     and less threatening, but "AI" stuck.
</li>
<li>AI from the start embraced the idea of duplicating human faculties
     such as creativity.

<li>John McCarthy referred to this period as the "Look, Ma, no hands!"
     era.

     representation with deductive processes.

<ul>
<li>In this program the procedures will be described as much as
       possible in the language itself and, in particular, the
       heuristics are all so described.
</li>
<li>If one wants a machine to be able to discover an abstraction, it
       seems most likely that the machine must be able to represent

       they have nothing to say about it except what can be deduced
       from its structure. On the other hand, to most Americans the
       number 1776 is an object because they have filed somewhere the
       fact that it represents the year when the American Revolution
       started.
</li>
<li>One might conjecture that division in man between conscious and
       unconscious thought occurs at the boundary between
       stimulus-response heuristics which do not have to be reasoned
       about but only obeyed, and the others which have to serve as

</li>
<li>Rationality: performance measure, agent's prior (i.e. <i>a priori</i>)
     knowledge, agent's actions, agent's percept sequence.<sup><a class="footref" name="fnr.7" href="#fn.7">7</a></sup>
<ul>
<li>"Percept," it turns out, is the converse of "concept": "A
       Percept or Intuition is a single representation . . . a Concept
       is a collective (general or universal) representation of a
       whole class of things." (F. C. Bowen Treat. Logic)
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>For each percept sequence, a rational agent should select an
     action that is expected to maximize its performance measure,
     given its percept sequence and a priori knowledge.
</li>
<li>Omniscience vs. rationality
</li>
<li>Rationality maximizes <i>expected</i> performance; perfection,
     <i>actual</i> performance.
</li>
<li>Our definition of rationality does not require omniscience.

<li>It's possible sometimes, by the way, to detect transitions in

</li>
<li>Information gathering: actions in order to modify future

<li><i>a priori</i> rather than percepts: lacks autonomy.

</li>
<li>Competitive vs. cooperative multiagent environment
</li>
<li>Communication
</li>
<li>In some competitive environments, randomized behavior is rational
     because it avoids predictability.
</li>
<li>Deterministic vs. stochastic environment
</li>
<li>"Uncertain" environment: not fully observable or not
     deterministic
</li>
<li>Stochastic: uncertainty about outcomes quantified in terms of
     probabilities; nondeterministic: actions characterized by
     possible outcomes, no probabilities attached.
</li>
<li>Episodal vs. sequential: atomic episodes: receives percept and
     performs single action; sequential: current decision affect all
     future decisions.
</li>
<li>Static vs. dynamic: environment change while agent is
     deliberating.
</li>
<li>Discrete vs. continuous: state of the environment, time,

       since we don't have all the nice characters (like upside-down
       A) that we would like to use." We can use ‚àÄ in Scheme, can't
       we? Sure. Tough to type? Maybe. Also, think font-lock.

<li>May not be up-to-date for 3e; let's see; also, rife with

<li>Damn, they implemented unification.

</li>
<li>The job of AI is to design an agent program that implements the
     agent function, the mapping from percepts to actions.
</li>
<li>Agent = architecture + program
</li>
<li>The agent program takes the current percept as input; the agent
     function, which takes the entire percept history.
</li>
<li>The agent function that the program embodies
</li>
<li>Write programs that produce rational behavior from a smallish
     program rather than a vast table.
</li>
<li>Reflex agents; model-based reflex agents; goal-based agents;
     utility-based agents.

</li>
<li>Works only if the correct decision can be made on the current
       percept: i.e. if the environment is fully observable.
</li>
<li>Escape from infinite loops is possible if the agent can randomize
       its actions.
</li>
<li>In single-agent environments, randomization is usually not
       rational.
</li>
<li>In most cases we can do better with more sophisticated
       deterministic agents.

<li>Whereas goals are happy/unhappy, more general performance
       measure: utility
</li>
<li>Utility functional: internalization of performance measure
</li>
<li>This is not the only way to be rational: rational agent for
       vacuum has no idea what its utility function is (see exercise
       <a href="#sec-3">1.3</a>).
</li>
<li>When there are conflicting goals, utility function opts for the
       appropriate tradeoff.

<li>Partial observability, stochasticity: decision making under

</li>
<li>Expected utility of the action outcomes: derive, given the
       probabilities and utilities of each outcome.
</li>
<li>Any rational agent must behave as if it possesses a utility
       function.
</li>
<li>An agent that possesses an explicit utility function can make
       rational decisions with a general-purpose algorithm that does not
       depend on the specific utility function being maximized.

</li>
<li>\(h(n) \leq c(n, a, n^\prime) +

              \(h(n)\), that would violate the property that \(h(n)\) is a

           \(h(n)\) is consistent.
</li>

</li>
<li>There would have to be another frontier node n<sup>&prime;</sup> on
           the optimal path, by the graph selection property of 3.9.
</li>
<li>See page 77: The frontier separates the state-space graph
           into the explored region and the unexplored region, so that
           every path from the inital state to an unexplored state has
           to pass through a state in the frontier. (This is the graph
           separation property.)
</li>
<li>With an admissible but inconsistent heuristic, \(A^*\)
           requires some extra book-keeping to ensure optimality.
</li>
<li>It follows that the sequence of nodes expanded by \(A^*\) is
           in non-decreasing order of \(f(n)\). Hence, the first goal
           node selected for expansion must be an optimal solutian
           because \(f\) is the true cost for goal nodes (which have
           \(h=0\)) and all later goal nodes will be at least as
           expensive.
</li>
<li>The fact that \(f\)-costs are non-decreasing means we can
           draw contours in the state space.
</li>
<li>\(A^*\) fans out from the start node, adding nodes in
           concertric bands of increasing \(f\)-cost.
</li>
<li>With uniform-cost search (\(A^*\) using \(h(n) = 0\)), the
           bands will be circular; more accurate heuristics: bands
           will stretch toward the goal state and become more
           narrowlsy focused around the optimal path.
</li>
<li>\(A^*\) expands all nodes with \(f(n) &lt; C^*\).
</li>
<li>\(A^*\) might expand some nodes on the goal-contour before
           selecting the goal node.
</li>
<li>Completeness requires that there be only finitely many
           nodes with cost less than or equal to \(C^*\), a condition
           that is true if all step costs exceed some finite
           \(\epsilon\) and if \(b\) is finite.
<ul>
<li>(Actually (i.e. accidentally) finite, or finite in
             principle? The latter doesn't matter; but we can put
             upper bounds on \(b\) in the case of e.g. tries.
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Subtree below Timisoara is pruned: because \(h_{SLD}\) is
           admissible.
</li>
<li>\(A^*\) is optimally efficient for any given consistent
           heuristic: no other optimal algorithm is guaranteed to
           expand fewer nodes than \(A^*\) (except possibly
           tie-breaking). Any algorithm that does not expand all nodes
           with \(f(n) &lt; C\) runs the risk of missing the optimal
           solution.
</li>
<li>The catch is that the number of states within the goal
           contour search space is still exponential.
</li>
<li>Absolute error, relative error
</li>
<li>Simplest model: state space, single goal, tree with

</li>
<li>Memory-bounded heuristic search

           (\(g + h\)) rather than the depth. Practical for unit step
           costs; avoid the overhead of sorted queue of nodes.
</li>
<li>Recursive best-first search: using linear space

<li>There are limitations to the powers of discrete-state

<p>
    If we get too fancy, it's going to take us a while; why not just
    draw a couple random barriers in a box? Not enough to probably
    block access, &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
    The world should be a graph; we'll search on that graph and thereby
    anticipate chapter 3. Debug output can produce an animated graph
    over graphviz (see e.g. the Iraq project). Show how the agent moves
    and the squares clean?
</p>
<p>
    If we want to create a random graph, but not necessarily a maze
    that fills up a given extent, we can specify e.g. the number of
    nodes. We have to have some condition for backtracking, though:
    random? The fill-up-an-extent maze-algorithm backtracks when it has
    no unseen neighbors; I suppose we can weight backtrack vs. branch
    differently and see what happens. I wonder whether e.g. 50/50 will
    produce a graph with a lot of shallow paths and high branching.
    Make backtracking and branching relatively expensive, then.
</p>
<p>
    The random reflex agent might do well in a completely connected
    graph, incidentally, since it doesn't have to make any decisions
    about where to go; it might fair poorly in a linear environment,
    since at least half of the time it will be unable to move.
</p>
<p>
    It turns out that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_graph">random graphs</a> are an open topic of research; with
    the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi_model">Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi</a>, <a href="#Watts-Strogatz">Watts-Strogatz</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barab√°si‚ÄìAlbert_model">Barab√°si‚ÄìAlbert</a> models. Let's go
    with Barab√°si‚ÄìAlbert: it looks relatively easy to implement and has
    interesting clustering properties (power-law degree-distributions).
</p>
<p>
    Confer <a href="http://igraph.sourceforge.net/doc/R/ba.game.html">Gabor Csardi's implementation of Barab√°si-Albert</a>, which has
    zero-appeal and power-of-preferential-attachment parameters; it
    also begins with one node. It can dispense with the two nodes from
    WP because of the zero-appeal parameter. It also does directed and
    undirected; and distinguishes, somehow, between in- and both
    in-and-out-degrees. It also does not divide by the total number of
    nodes (or is it the total number of edges?).
</p>
<p>
    (Holy shit: <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/simulating-small-world-networks/184405611">this chick</a> implements all three in Perl; she claims
    that you divide by all the degrees in the graph, which is
    consistent with WP's notation. With Gabor Csardi, she also has a
    parameter \(m\) of edges to add at each time; her graph also starts
    with no edges, but has \(m_0\) nodes at \(t_0\); they both discuss the
    problem of multiple edges: it may not suffice to merely not
    generate them, you should detect and ignore them. No, wait; she's
    talking about something different: "To keep the code simple, I
    don't test whether the \(m\) nodes that are connecting to the new
    node are all different." Gabor, on other hand, talks about an
    algorithm which "never generates multiple edges." Wait again: she's
    talking about the same thing. Should we ignore duplicate links and
    add another; or just refrain from duplicating? Damn.)
</p>
<p>
    It sounds like we can create a connected-graph if we start with the
    seed-graph-of-degree-one hack; using zero-appeal, we might have
    disconnected but dirty squares. Disconnected but dirty squares are
    romantic, however; and their effect should fall prey to the law of
    large numbers if we repeat it enough times.
</p>
<p>
    We are, of course, constrained by the relative directions up, down,
    left and right; the degree of any node is therefore \(\leq 4\). In
    that sense, maybe the matrix is a reasonable representation?
    Barab√°si-Albert isn't going to be able to create hubs with that
    sort of upper bound. Push forward anyway, or capitulate to grid?
</p>
<p>
    I like the idea of a graph, each of whose nodes contains \(0 \leq
    neighbors \leq 4\); which are assigned the arbitrary designations
    <code>up</code>, <code>down</code>, <code>left</code> and <code>right</code>. The only problem is that, for
    experimentation, we're going to have to generate a complete
    grid-like world. That is a pain in the ass.
</p>
<p>
    I take that back: can we create something like a torus or a sphere
    where the grid wraps around; that is, where every square is totally
    connected (edges being connected to the opposite edge)? A random
    reflex-vacuum might be able to do well there.
</p>
<p>
    If with modified Barab√°si-Albert we're going to have disconnected
    nodes, by the way, if e.g. \(p_i\) is false for every node; or are we
    guaranteed to connect \(m\) nodes every time? See <a href="http://eaton.math.rpi.edu/CSUMS/Papers/ScaleFree/Scale-Free%20Networks.pdf">e.g.</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The generalized creation process of a scale-free-network is defined
by Barabasi and Albert [BaBo03]: Start with a small number of nodes
\(m0\). During each step, insert a new node with connections to \(m
\leq m0\) existing nodes. The probability \(P_v\) of node \(v\) being
connected to a new node depends on its degree \(j_v\). The higher its
degree, the greater the probability that it will receive new
connections ("the rich get richer").
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
    Since there's an <a href="http://www.bsse.ethz.ch/cobi/education/Math_Mod_basic/ex8_2011.pdf">upper bound</a> on the dividend, we're going to
    degenerate into a network whose edges are picked at random; and,
    worse yet, might end up with many unconnected nodes.
</p>
<p>
    Can't we just create the world initially, by the way, instead of
    creating the graph and then the world? Interestingly, the relative
    directions won't meet up: <code>up</code> is paired with <code>left</code>, &amp;c. Is such a
    world physically possible? Yes, if the relative directions for each
    location are different; they're relative, after all. It shouldn't
    matter to the agents.
</p>
<p>
    It's a weird world, though.
</p>
<p>
    I want to have an environment that spits out an animated graph of
    where the agent is (green), which cells are dirty (grey), which are
    clean (white).

    encountered an obstacle based on whether or not the last action
    was movement and whether or not it's in the same position (this

<p>   See <a href="http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2htmllabel=algorithms">this survey</a>. Algorithm2e isn't bad; doesn't seem to have a

   if the output is a little ugly.

<p>
   The alternative, I suppose, is straight up lists.

   Algorithm2e has to be wrapped in dollars, which sucks; also:
   bizarre camel-case macros. Looks good, otherwise. Has no functions,
   apparently, either.

<p>  I wonder if it would be worthwhile to study the canonical Lisp
