  - Two dimensions: thought vs. action, humanity vs. rationality.
  - Physical simulation of a person is unnecessary for intelligence.
    - Mind-body dualism of Descartes?
  - Cognitive science brings together computer models from AI and
    experimental techniques from psychology.
  - Real cognitive science, however, is necessarily based on
    experimental investigation of actual humans.
  - The standard of rationality is mathematically well defined and
    completely general.
  - We will adopt the working hypothesis that perfect rationality is a
    good starting point for analysis.
  - Limited rationality: acting appropriately when there is not enough
    time
  - Materialism, which holds that the brain's operation according to
    the laws of physicas constitutes the mind.
  - Logical positivism
  - Carnap, The Logical Structures of the World, was probably the
    first theory of mind as a computational process.
  - Intelligence requires action as well as reasoning.
  - Actions are justified by a logical connection between goals and
    knowledge of the action's outcome.
  - Regression planning system
  - The leap to a formal science required a level of mathematical
    formalization: logic, computation, probability.
  - The world is an extremely large problem instance.
  - Models based on satisficing---making decisions that are "good
    enough"---gave a better description of actual human behavior.
  - Searle: brains cause minds.
  - Behaviorism
  - "A cognitive theory should be like a computer program."
  - Intelligence and an artifact
  - Parallelism---a curious convergence with the properties of the
    brain.
  - The state of a neuron was conceived of as "factually equivalent to
    a proposition which proposed its adequate stimulus." McCulloch and
    Pitts (1943)
    - Neural events and the relations among them can be treated by
      means of propositional logic.
    - For any logical expression satisfying certain conditions, one
      can find a net behaving in the fashion it describes.
    - For every net behaving under one assumption, there exists
      another net which behaves under the other and gives the same
      results.
  - Perhaps "computational rationality" would have been more precise
    and less threatening, but "AI" stuck.
  - AI from the start embraced the idea of duplicating human faculties
    such as creativity.
  - John McCarthy referred to this period as the "Look, Ma, no hands!"
    era.
  - "A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means
    for general intelligent action."
  - 1958 . . . McCarthy define Lisp, which was to become the dominant
    AI programming language for the next 30 years.
  - It is useful to have a formal, explicit representation of the
    world and its workings and to be able to maniplutae that
    representation with deductive processes.
  - McCarthy, Programs with Common Sense
    - In this program the procedures will be described as much as
      possible in the language itself and, in particular, the
      heuristics are all so described.
    - If one wants a machine to be able to discover an abstraction, it
      seems most likely that the machine must be able to represent
      this abstraction in some relatively simple way.
    - The improving mechanism should be improvable.
    - Must have or evolve concepts of partial success.
      - Something about ~1995 that made for a cute blog.
    - For example, to mest people, the number 3812 is not an object:
      they have nothing to say about it except what can be deduced
      from its structure. On the other hand, to most Americans the
      number 1776 is an object because they have filed somewhere the
      fact that it represents the year when the American Revolution
      started.
    - One might conjecture that division in man between conscious and
      unconscious thought occurs at the boundary between
      stimulus-response heuristics which do not have to be reasoned
      about but only obeyed, and the others which have to serve as
      premises in deductions.

  - Failure to come to grips with the "combinatorial explosion"
  - The new back-propagation learning algorithms for multilayer
    netwrks that were to cause an enormous resurgence in neural-net
    research in the late 1980s were actually discovered first in 1969.
  - Bruce Buchanan: a philosopher turned computer scientist
  - DENDRAL was the first successful knowledge-intensive system
    (expert system).
  - AI Winter
  - Parallel Distributed Processing (Rumelhart, McClelland. 1986)
  - Connectionist models: competitors to symbols models and logicist
    approach
  - Ones that act rationally according to the laws of decision theory
    and do not try to imitate the thought steps of human experts
  - Control theory deals with designing devices that act optimally on
    the basis of feedback from the environment.
