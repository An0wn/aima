  - Two dimensions: thought vs. action, humanity vs. rationality.
  - Physical simulation of a person is unnecessary for intelligence.
    - Mind-body dualism of Descartes?
  - Cognitive science brings together computer models from AI and
    experimental techniques from psychology.
  - Real cognitive science, however, is necessarily based on
    experimental investigation of actual humans.
  - The standard of rationality is mathematically well defined and
    completely general.
  - We will adopt the working hypothesis that perfect rationality is a
    good starting point for analysis.
  - Limited rationality: acting appropriately when there is not enough
    time
  - Materialism, which holds that the brain's operation according to
    the laws of physicas constitutes the mind.
  - Logical positivism
  - Carnap, The Logical Structures of the World, was probably the
    first theory of mind as a computational process.
  - Intelligence requires action as well as reasoning.
  - Actions are justified by a logical connection between goals and
    knowledge of the action's outcome.
  - Regression planning system
  - The leap to a formal science required a level of mathematical
    formalization: logic, computation, probability.
  - The world is an extremely large problem instance.
  - Models based on satisficing---making decisions that are "good
    enough"---gave a better description of actual human behavior.
  - Searle: brains cause minds.
  - Behaviorism
  - "A cognitive theory should be like a computer program."
  - Intelligence and an artifact
  - Parallelism---a curious convergence with the properties of the
    brain.
  - The state of a neuron was conceived of as "factually equivalent to
    a proposition which proposed its adequate stimulus." McCulloch and
    Pitts (1943)
    - Neural events and the relations among them can be treated by
      means of propositional logic.
    - For any logical expression satisfying certain conditions, one
      can find a net behaving in the fashion it describes.
    - For every net behaving under one assumption, there exists
      another net which behaves under the other and gives the same
      results.
  - Perhaps "computational rationality" would have been more precise
    and less threatening, but "AI" stuck.
  - AI from the start embraced the idea of duplicating human faculties
    such as creativity.
  - John McCarthy referred to this period as the "Look, Ma, no hands!"
    era.
  - "A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means
    for general intelligent action."
  - 1958 . . . McCarthy define Lisp, which was to become the dominant
    AI programming language for the next 30 years.
  - It is useful to have a formal, explicit representation of the
    world and its workings and to be able to maniplutae that
    representation with deductive processes.
  - McCarthy, Programs with Common Sense
    - In this program the procedures will be described as much as
      possible in the language itself and, in particular, the
      heuristics are all so described.
    - If one wants a machine to be able to discover an abstraction, it
      seems most likely that the machine must be able to represent
      this abstraction in some relatively simple way.
    - The improving mechanism should be improvable.
    - Must have or evolve concepts of partial success.
      - Something about ~1995 that made for a cute blog.
    - For example, to mest people, the number 3812 is not an object:
      they have nothing to say about it except what can be deduced
      from its structure. On the other hand, to most Americans the
      number 1776 is an object because they have filed somewhere the
      fact that it represents the year when the American Revolution
      started.
    - One might conjecture that division in man between conscious and
      unconscious thought occurs at the boundary between
      stimulus-response heuristics which do not have to be reasoned
      about but only obeyed, and the others which have to serve as
      premises in deductions.

    research in the late 1980s were actually discovered first in 1969.

  - Intelligence :: A spontaneous faculty for associating impressions
                    (more general than ideas); synthesizing
                    abstractions from disparate stimuli; deducing
                    conclusions from abstractions.

                    Intelligence is an emergent property of simples
                    like e.g. neurons.
  - Artificial intelligence :: Mechanism for performing association,
       abstraction, deduction which appears to be spontaneous; may
       also be an emergent property of bit-pushing.
  - Agent :: Self-contained, autonomous input-processing mechanism.
  - Rationality :: The appropriate application of /λόγος/ or /ratio/;
                   this includes the mechanical process of deduction,
                   as well as an ill-defined notion of common-sense.
  - Logical reasoning :: The mechanical aspect of rationality.

  The Mathematical Objection (3) still holds up: the halting problem;
  on the other hands, humans are also susceptible to the halting
  problem, aren't they? If one falls towards the humanity side of the
  humanity-rationality AI-axis, this deficit is reducible.

  Lady Lovelace's Objection (6) is interesting: it denies /ex nihilo/;
  are genetic algorithms a counter-example?

  The Argument from Informality of Behaviour (8) could be solved by
  fuzzy dispatch.

  A modern refutation might be that there are not enough graduate
  students to make a satisfactory ontology of world-knowledge; thank
  the gods, then, for mechanical turks and unsupervised learning!

  We came pretty damn close to 30% in the 2008 [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loebner_Prize#2008][Loebner prize]]; why not
  double it to 60% in 2058? Despite Moore's law, let's say that AI
  proceeds linearly.
** Turing, Computing Machinery and Intelligence
   - Can machines think?
   - It is A's object in the game to try and cause C to make the wrong
     identification.
     - Didn't realize there was an adversarial element to the Turing
       test.
   - What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this game?
   - . . . drawing a fairly sharp line between the physical and the
     intellectual capacities of man.
     - A reasonable dualism
   - May not machines carry out something which ought to be described
     as thinking but which is very different from what a man does?
     - The humanity/rationality plane of AI?
   - Imitation game
     - Simulacrum sufficeth
   - It is probably possible to rear a complete individual from a
     single cell of the skin (say) of a man . . . but we would not be
     inclined to regard it as a case of "constructing a thinking
     machine".
   - Digital computer:
     1. Store
     2. Executive unit
     3. Control
   - It is not normally possible to determine from observing a machine
     whether it has a random element, for a similar effect can be
     produced by such devices as making the choices depend on the
     digits of the decimal for $\pi$.
   - Discrete state machines: strictly speaking there are no such
     machines. Everything really moves continuously.
   - This is reminiscent of Laplace's view that from the complete
     state of the universe at one moment of time, as described by the
     positions and velocities of all particles, it should be possible
     to predict all future states.
   - This special property of digital computers, that they can mimic
     any discrete state machine, is described by saying that they are
     universal machines.
   - "Are there imaginable digital computers which would do well in
     the imitation game?" $\to$ "Are there discrete state machines
     which would do well?"
   - I believe that in about fifty years' time it will be possible to
     programme computers, with a storage capacity of about $10^9$, to
     make them play the imitation game so well that an average
     interrogator will not have more than $70%$ chance of making the
     right identification after five minutes of questioning.

       #+BEGIN_QUOTE
       Elbot of Artificial Solutions won the 2008 Loebner Prize bronze
       award, for most human-like artificial conversational entity,
       through fooling three of the twelve judges who interrogated it
       (in the human-parallel comparisons) into believing it was
       human. This is coming very close to the 30% traditionally
       required to consider that a program has actually passed the
       Turing test.
       #+END_QUOTE
       - From a [[http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/article4934858.ece][judge]]:
         #+BEGIN_QUOTE
         He predicted that by the end of the century, computers would
         have a 30 per cent chance of being mistaken for a human being
         in five minutes of text-based conversation.
         #+END_QUOTE
         I thought this was mistaken (should be $70$), but it is
         indeed correct.
     - In other words, a damn-good guess.
   - Conjectures are of great importance since they suggest useful
     lines of research.
   - We might expect that He would only exercise this power in
     conjunction with a mutation which provided the elephant with an
     appropriately improved brain to minister to the needs of this
     soul.
   - We like to believe that Man is in some subtle way superior to the
     rest of creation.
   - "The consequences of machines thinking would be too dreadful." I
     do not think that this argument sufficiently substantial to
     require refutation. Consolation would would be more appropriate:
     perhaps this should be sought the transmigration of souls.
   - There are limitations to the powers of discrete-state
     machines. The best known of these results is known as Gödel's
     theorem, and shows that in any sufficiently powerful logical
     system statements can be formulated which can neither be proved
     nor disproved within the system, unless possibly the system
     itself is inconsistent.
   - "Will this machine every answer 'Yes' to any question?" It can be
     shown that the answer is either wrong or not forthcoming.
   - The only way to know that a man thinks is to be that particular
     man. It is in fact the solipsist point of view.
   - I do not wish to give the impression that I think there is no
     mystery about consciousness. There is, for instance, something of
     a paradox connected with any attempt to localise it.
   - When a burnt child fears the fire and shows that he fears it by
     avoiding it, I should say that he was applying scientific
     induction.
   - It would deliberately introduce mistakes in a manner calculated
     to confuse the interrogator.
   - By observing the results of its own behaviour it can modify its
     own programmes so as to achieve some purpose more effectively.
   - This is the assumption that as soon as a fact is presented to a
     mind all consequences of that fact spring into the mind
     simultaneously with it.
   - The undistributed middle is glaring.
   - I would defy anyone to learn from these replies sufficint about
     the programme to be able to predict any replies to untried
     values.
   - A smallish proportion are super-critical. An idea presented to
     such a mind may give rise to a whole "theory" consisting of
     secondary, tertiary and more remote ideas.
     - Sponteneity
   - These last two paragraphs should be described as "recitations
     tending to produce belief."
   - The only satisfactory support that can be given will be that
     provided by waiting for the end of the century and then doing the
     experiment described.
   - Estimates for the storage capacity of the brain vary from $10^10$
     to $10^15$ binary digits.
     - Russell/Norvig (12): $10^13$ synapses
   - At my present rate of working I produce about a thousand digits
     of programme a day, so that about sixty workers, working steadily
     through the fifty years might accomplish the job, if nothing went
     into the waste-paper basket.
     - Mythical man-month?
   - The child-programme and the education process
   - One might have a complete system of logical inference "built
     in". The store would be largely occupied with definitions and
     propositions. Certain propositions may be described as
     "imperatives". As soon as an imperative is classed as
     "well-established" the appropriate action takes place.
     - Compare McCarthy, Programs with Common Sense, regarding
       imperatives.
   - These choices make the difference between a brilliant and a
     footling reasoner.
   - We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty
     there that needs to be done.
